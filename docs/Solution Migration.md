# The Challenge 

Drone Shuttle’s website runs on outdated platform in their datacenter; they are launching new products which will lead to more social media presence and traffic with a blog platform. They decided they want to use the Ghost Blog platform for their marketing efforts. 
The Task is to deliver a Proof of Concept for their new website.

## Business drivers


- **Address business growth.** DroneShuttles is growing and releasing new products, and they currently run on their own on-premises systems and infrastructure.
- **Increase Reseliency.** DroneShuttles needs to  remain online even in case of a significant geographical failure
- **Increase agility.** DroneShuttles IT needs to be more responsive to the needs of the business. It must be able to react faster than the changes in the marketplace, to enable success in a global economy. Deployment of the application needs to be automated.
- **Scale.** As the business grows successfully, DroneShuttles IT must provide systems that are able to grow at the same pace. x 4 load
- **Future Proof.** DroneShuttles wants to optimize licensing costs.


## Migration goals

To help determine the best migration method, the DroneShuttles requiremnets where mapped to certain goals:

| Requirements | Details |
| --- | --- |
| **Application Availability** | The application in Azure will remain as critical as it is today on-premises. <br><br> It should have performance capabilities of 4 times it's current load <br><br> 
| **Azure** | DroneShuttles wants to move it's application to the cloud, Azure. |
| **DevOps** | DroneShuttles wants to move to a DevOps model that uses Azure DevOps for their builds and release pipelines. |

## Solution design

After pinning down their goals and requirements, I present  a deployment solution. This includes the migration process, including the Azure services that they'll use for the migration.

### Current Application Assumptions

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82387743/151895618-c070a3d1-3b1a-4321-9405-345761e0a4c8.png)

-	Application is built with spring boot and angular, angular is deployed in Apache web server. Spring boot application was deployed in tomcat server. It can be accessed from the intranet and internet. The application relies on Microsoft Active Directory services to authenticate employees.
-	Uses a standard Microsoft SQL Server 2019 database for storing application data. 
-	Stores the images uploaded to or created from the application using network file storage. Is hosted on single instance server.


### Migration Methodology.
With the assessment complete, I then   identify tools to move its applications, data, and infrastructure to Azure.

A simple **“lift and shift migration” (IAAS)** could have been chosen but given the fact that the requirements of the website and to fully **maximize the potential of the azure cloud capabilities** - the solution focused on also the future and did not see the need for 5 Devops Engineer on the website which will already be using a platform like Ghost that has a SAAS option. So  **PAAS serveless**  option was chosen
The main functionality stays the same with a different architecture; a **REVAMP**  totally in the cloud. 
It modernizes an application into a resilient, highly scalable, independently deployable architecture.

-	Migrate the front-end website to the Web Apps feature of Azure App Service.
-	Migrate PostgreSQL to Azure Database for PostgreSQL (a managed database service for app development and deployment).



## Solution review
An  evaluation of proposed design by putting together a pros and cons list, as shown in the following table:

| Consideration | Details |
| --- | --- |
| **Pros** | The DroneShuttles web application will be built via GhostBlog platform for deployemnt migration to Azure. <br><br> After the deployemnt, Windows Server won't need to be supported. For more information, see the [Microsoft Lifecycle Policy](/lifecycle/). <br><br> DroneShuttles can configure the web tier of the application with multiple instances, so that the web tier is no longer a single point of failure. <br><br> The database will no longer depend on the aging SQL Server. <br><br> Azure SQL Database has built-in fault tolerance that DroneShuttles doesn't have to set up. This ensures that the data tier is no longer a single point of failover. <br><br> If DroneShuttles uses Azure Database Migration Service to migrate their database, it will have the infrastructure ready for migrating databases at scale. |
| **Cons** | Azure App Service supports only one application deployment for each web app. <br><br> Requires Platform Expertise | 

### Determine costs

To determine costs and the potential savings of Azure migration, made  use the [total cost of ownership (TCO) calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/tco/calculator/) to calculate and compare the TCO for Azure to a comparable on-premises deployment.

Over 5 year(s) with Microsoft Azure, the estimated cost savings could be as much as **€75,261**
                              
                                                **Total on-premises vs. Azure cost over time**

## Proposed architecture

Here's the proposed architecture:

- The web tier application will be hosted using the **ghost blog** platform and built using an **Azure App Service web app** in two Azure regions. 
- The application code will be moved to GitHub, and the Azure App Service web app will be configured for continuous delivery with GitHub.
- Azure App Service will be deployed in both the primary region (`West Europe`) and secondary region (`Central US`).
- Azure Traffic Manager will be set up in front of the two web apps in both regions.
- Traffic Manager will be configured in priority mode to force the traffic through `West Europe`.
- If the Azure app server in `West Europe` goes offline, users can access the failed over application in `Central US`.
- The application database will be migrated to the Azure Database for MySQL service by using Azure Database Migration Service. The on-premises database will be backed up locally, and restored directly to Azure Database for MySQL.
- The database will reside in the primary region (`West Europe`) `.
- The Traffic Manager resource will be deployed in DroneShuttles's infrastructure resource group `droneshuttles`.
- Azure Monitor: Application Insights, provides health and performance monitoring, and diagnostics.
- The on-premises machines in the DroneShuttles datacenter will be decommissioned after the migration is done.

  **Data Flow**
  1. User accesses Web Apps from Azure App Service in a browser.
  2. Traffic Manager checks to see which web app is geographically best placed to handle each request.
  3. Application Insights detects issues and analyses usage for your web apps.
  4. Web App connects to SQL Database and Azure Cache for Redis for better performance.
  5. Browser pulls resourcesfrom Azure Content Delivery Network to reduce load time.

### Migration process

DroneShuttles completes the migration process as follows:

1. As a first step, DroneShuttles admins set up the Azure infrastructure, including provisioning Azure App Service, setting up Traffic Manager, and provisioning an Azure Database for MySQL instance.
2. After preparing the Azure infrastructure, they migrate the database by using Azure Database Migration Service.
3. Install ghostblog machine and build web app 
4. After the database is running in Azure, they upload a GitHub private repository for Azure App Service with continuous delivery, and load it with the web application.
5. In the Azure portal, they load the application from GitHub  by running Azure App Service.
6. They tweak DNS settings and configure autoscaling for the application.

>
> - **Step 1: Provision Azure App Service**. DroneShuttles will provision web apps in the primary and secondary regions.
> - **Step 2: Set up Traffic Manager**. set up Traffic Manager in front of the web apps, for routing and load balancing traffic.
> - **Step 3: Provision Azure Database for MySQL**. In Azure,  provision an instance of Azure Database for MySQL.
> - **Step 4: Migrate the database**.  migrate the database by using Azure Database Migration Service.
> - **Step 5: Set up GitHub**.  set up a local GitHub repository for the application web sites that was built using *Ghost Blog Platform* and code.
> - **Step 6: Configure the web apps**. They configure the web apps with the DroneShuttles websites.

## Review the deployment

With the application now running, DroneShuttles needs to fully operationalize and secure their new infrastructure.

### Security

DroneShuttles reviews the application to determine any security issues. 
This to ensure that the database traffic can't be hacked. [Learn more](/azure/mysql/howto-configure-ssl).

### Backups

Azure Database for MySQL automatically creates server backups and stores.[Learn more](/azure/mysql/concepts-backup).

### Licensing and cost optimization

- There are no licensing issues for the PaaS deployment.
- DroneShuttles  use [Azure Cost Management + Billing](/azure/cost-management-billing/cost-management-billing-overview) to ensure that they stay within the budgets established by their IT leadership.
